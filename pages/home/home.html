"You’re probably aware that your body burns energy all the time, no matter what you’re doing.
</p>

<p>
But have you ever wondered how much energy you’re burning throughout the day, or when you’re indulging in big-time calorie burners, like running or lifting weights?
</p>

<p>
One way to calculate your body’s energy expenditure is with metabolic equivalents, also known as METs. You might see METs listed on exercise equipment or mentioned by personal trainers to help you measure your physical activity."
